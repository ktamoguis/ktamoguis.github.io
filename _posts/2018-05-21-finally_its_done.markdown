Relief! That's how I felt in one word.

My CLI project was a series of ups and downs,  which in the end, I hope, has further improved my patience and determination. I think that as a developer one will encounter this cycle again and again, so I better get used to it. With the ups and downs aplenty, it was good -for me at least - to be grateful for the small and big wins as they helped me see the project through.

My project took more than a week to finish, as I was beset with technical problems:  write permissions in my local environment, scraping a difficult website, installing and running my app as an executable file.  In each case, I asked the help of a technical coach, which was really helpful and I'm very grateful for. 

The **Coding Process** for me was like below:
1. **Project Ideation/Submission**

2.  **Study how to approach the project**: I watched the CLI Data Gem Walkthrough to see the thought process of the developer. I also tried to replicate the steps done there especially when making a gem. After that, I reviewed again the past Scraper lessons and labs. Here I tried to review the architecture of the program. I ended up making one of the labs as template for my project.

3.  **Coding**: Here I made a quick code of the classes that I needed, like building the skeleton of the app. I made classes and then class and instance methods. I then finished the Scraper class first as the code here was more like trial and method for me. At this point also, I knew around 90% what my scraped data would look like.  Coding the CLI class came last, mostly because there were lots of fine tuning on how the interface would look like. While all of this is being done, I tried to run and debug the code everytime. When an instance method was done for example, I'll run my code and try to see if there were bugs. Thank goodness for pry!

4.  **Finishing up**: Here it's just making the program into a gem and having an executable file in the folder. 

As each technical problem above took around a couple of days to resolve, coding for the project turned out to be the easier part for me. The lessons and the labs leading to this project really helped as the learnings there made for a smoother, less painful coding experience.

**Key Takeaways** From the Project Experience: 
1. **Begin with the end in mind** - I should have checked first the website I planned to scrape before proposing my project. As I later found out with a technical coach, the website for my project was difficult to scrape and I found another website which was a lot easier for scraping. I had to change my project midway, but I already have some usable code so I just reused those in my new project.

2. **Keep calm and do things within your control**- It's easy to get frustrated when one gets stuck, but there's nothing else to do about it but try to get unstuck. Do things one at a time and learn as much as possible from the experience - so it won't happen again. 

3. **Be positive** - Big or small, celebrate the wins, especially when one gets unstuck :)  The situation may not change but how you react to it matters. Being positive will help you get through any experience.
