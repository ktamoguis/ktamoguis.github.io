I think one of the most important and deeper reasons for me to go into Web Development is the need to create something of value. With Web Development, one gets the tools to do just that. I would like to create apps that would be helpful and useful in the real world.

My educational background and present career does allow me to create useful and helpful things but in pursuing this course, I hope I would be able to do more.

During my years at work, I've thought myself visual basic programming because I thought it would greatly speed up work at the office. I've also felt more at ease writing and reading lines of code, at least more than most people at the office.

As the famous saying goes: "Know Thyself" and based on my life experience, I'm thinking that going into Full Stack Web Development would be a good career and life choice.

It took me a while to get here. I've always wondered how great it would be to have formal training for a course that I wanted to learn about. When I wanted to learn something before I just basically bought lots of books about the topic and learn my way through reading and practice.

I've gone to a couple of  online schools before but I'm encouraged by the support I get from Flatiron in terms of technical coaching and the study groups.
